# Diagnosing-Diabetes-Using-MachineLearning-Techniques
This mini projects are done using Jupyter notebook.
In this experiment : applying the classification techniques to diagnose diabetes disease 
Performed on Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD).
Four classification algorithms are chosen and compared to select the diagnosing model which performs best for the dataset. 
The classifiers are: Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression.
The strategy followed has many steps: 
*data exploration, 
*data preprocessing,
*feature selection, 
*model selection, 
*model evaluation.
